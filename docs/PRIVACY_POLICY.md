# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

This extension does not collect any of your data to be stored.

Since no data is collected, naturally your data will not be sold to third parties.

## storage API

Used to persist extension settings (on/off, search criteria, etc.).

This data is only accessed locally on the user's machine and is never transmitted.

## Host permissions

This extension works by your action “selecting any string” or “registered shortcut key is called”.

Since it is impossible to predict in the future when it will be called, all pages are waiting for your event.

## Feedback

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please send an email or report an issue to this repository.
